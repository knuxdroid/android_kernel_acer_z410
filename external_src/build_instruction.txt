external
========

For building external projects, take the following commands as reference:

$ mkdir ~/AOSP

$ cd AOSP

Sync the corresponding codebase from Android website:

$ repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest -b android-4.4.4_r2

$ repo sync

Copy all folders from external_src to ~/AOSP/external (replace the original folders):

$ cp -r /PATH_TO/external_src/*  ~/AOSP/external/

$ source build/envsetup.sh

$ make
